# Checkd Coding Task

- [Github Repo](https://github.com/sohailshams/checkd)

## Description

The task was to pull data for an [API](https://frontend-tech-test-ashy.vercel.app/api/match) and build out a football data widget that displays the data.

- I tried to used semantic HTML tags instead of div tags for accessibility purpose. I also divided code into small components to make code readable and clean.
- I used fetch instead of other library like axios to pull data. The reason was, it has native browser support so no need to install third party library and for the purpose of this task it was suitable.
- I used tailwindcss instead of raw css because using tailwindcss make less code to write and makes development quick.
